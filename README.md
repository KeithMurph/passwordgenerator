# passwordgenerator


Goal was to make a random password generator depanding on the given criteria: Uppercase, LowerCase, special Characters, numbers and password length


Issues-I probably started and restated this project a dozen times, spent well over 20 hours on it and the closest I got was to get through the criteria pop ups and then the 
password was returned "undefined" in the password input.
